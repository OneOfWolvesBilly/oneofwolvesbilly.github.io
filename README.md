Hi, this is Chih-hao Chen, also Billy Chen. I'm a senior software engineer, and I have  4 years of experience. 

In my experience, I have worked more than 4 years and coded in Java, but I believe it's not necessary force in one language. I try to make some projects coding in other language like lua, katlin, and swift.
And I will leave them on GtHub.

If you have any questions please feel free to connect me.
