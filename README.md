I am a software engineer with 7 years of experience in full-stack Java development, mainly focused on the finance and tech industries. I am proficient in modern frameworks including Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Angular, Vue, and React. My career has involved multiple banking system integration and credit card service development projects, where I honed my skills in backend/frontend integration, cross-team collaboration, and agile methodology.

At Wistron ITS, I served as a system analyst leading an 8-person team to rebuild the corporate banking system for Cathay United Bank. I was responsible for system architecture design, technical planning, and project coordination. Later at ZT Digital, I contributed to blockchain and cryptocurrency trading platform development, working closely on wallet integration and transaction security.

More recently at Huida InfoTech, I participated in credit card backend transformation and external system development for HSBC, and supported KGI Bank in testing credit card systems in partnership with Microsoft. I left the company in October 2024 due to short-term medical recovery and am now fully recovered and actively looking for new opportunities.

Iâ€™m passionate about software development and continuously self-learning new technologies and architectures. I look forward to joining a team that values technical excellence, collaboration, and delivering high-quality digital services.
